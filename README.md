# AskOut

This was a hackathon project for StudentHack. Description from devpost:

University can be very lonely, especially for shy, first-year students. Sometimes, all you want is somebody to hang out with for lunch, for a beer, for a movie, maybe for the length of a flight. You're not alone in the struggle. Many other people may be looking for the very same thing. How about we bring two lonely kids together for coffee and conversation? AskOut aims to do just that: facilitate contact and the inner courage in everybody to ask out a complete stranger.

What it does
AskOut is a web-app, pinpointing all users in close proximity to each other and allowing them to talk to each other and organise a meet-up. It displays interests and topics of discussion, so that, if small talk fails, you can always bring out the big questions and see yourself fall into an enthralling conversation on politics, religion and whether or not Mary Poppins is a trickster God.
